## Getting start with this repo

### Dependencies

This repo includes a `.tool-versions` file which works with the [asdf][asdf]
version manager.

Install asdf and you can run `./scripts/bootstrap.sh` to get started.

If you are not using asdf you can reference the file for the versions of tools
to install.

### Quick start

Ensure you have a `.env` file (see `.env.sample` if not).

Using SQLite or an empty Postgres:

```shell
./manage.py migrate
./manage.py loaddata apps/pizza_shop/fixtures/*
./manage.py create_sample_orders 2 10
```

Now that you have a database configured with sample orders you can run
the pizza shop simulator to process them:

```shell
./manage.py run_pizza_shop_sim
```

While running the simulator you can open two additional terminals and run
the web stack.

Run the backend:

```shell
./manage.py runserver_plus
```

Run the frontend:

```shell
cd apps/pizza_shop/frontend
npm i
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173/ and place an order. üçï
